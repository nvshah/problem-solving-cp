-> If in given array, 1 element appears more than n//2 times then this algo works

- Assume king's crown to be claimed by diff element
  & it will bethrown to one having maximum power (ie frequency/counts)

  Start with assuming the first element is king (ie with count 1)

  as we move froward many new element will claim for crown with their counts
   & this will affect current king's popularity (ie thereby decreasing power)

   When current king power reaches 0 ->
   next time if someone claim then crown-will be allocated to him 

- repeat till all element are processed
