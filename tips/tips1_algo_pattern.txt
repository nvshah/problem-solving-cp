1. Leftmost Binary Search
   - Targets first occurence
   - Index where target should exists if its not present

  - First pos of element = leftmostbs(elem)
  - Last pos of element = leftmostbs(elem+1)-1

2. Deque  (All in one DS)
   - Linked List
   - Queue
   - Stack

3. HeapQ
   - Priority Queue (Min Heap)

4. String Concatenation
   - "".join([strings])
     or
     StringBuilder in java

5. To find kth largest
   - Use Quick Select Algo
   - Instead of HeapQ

6. BST & Inorder Traversal

7. Helper Pointer & Linked List
   dummy

8. Quick Select
   - Find kth smallest & kth largest in unordered list
   -> Works similarly the way how Quick Sort works
      but unlike instead of processing both left & right part, quick-select needs to deal with only one
      i.e instead of solving 2 halves it just focus on 1 halve in each pass
      (ie reducing domain logarithmically or exponetially in multiple of 2 each time)

   Q. How is this better than O(n log k)
   ->
